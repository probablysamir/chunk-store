# Example credentials.json file structure
# 
# This is what your credentials.json file should look like after downloading
# from Google Cloud Console. DO NOT use these example values - they won't work!
#
# To get your real credentials:
# 1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
# 2. Create a project and enable Google Drive API
# 3. Create OAuth2 credentials for a desktop application
# 4. Download the JSON file and rename it to credentials.json
